*Weight-space programming* was named in the MIT CSAIL report [Sparks of Weight-Space Programming](https://rikiyat.github.io/blog/weight-space-programming/) (2026-11-02). A general LLM is given another network's weights, sometimes with code and a budget of forward passes, and changes the numbers to explain, repair or build behavior. This list tracks the papers, code, benchmarks and critiques that follow, grouped by the kind of network being programmed. It is rebuilt from [`data/entries.json`](https://github.com/SajjadPSavoji/awesome-weight-space-programming/blob/main/data/entries.json).

## 🌟 The Original Report

*Where the term comes from.*

- **[Sparks of Weight-Space Programming: LLMs can natively read & write neural network weights](https://rikiyat.github.io/blog/weight-space-programming/)**  
  MIT CSAIL · *Blog report* · 2026-11-02 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Post](https://rikiyat.github.io/blog/weight-space-programming/)] [[Thread](https://x.com/rikiyatakehi/status/2117313742891327994)] [[Code](https://github.com/RikiyaT/lm_understand-logs)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RikiyaT/lm_understand-logs?style=social)  
  GPT-6 Astra names what networks were trained on from their weights alone, repairs a stuck Kinetix car policy (0% to 100%, 3.5% of weights, one reply, no tools), writes MinAtar and 9x9 Go networks from zero, and lifts Qwen3.5-0.8B on MATH-500 from 7.9% to 48.1% by removing a loop direction (0.016% of weights). Edits removed a blocker; they did not add a missing ability (Gemma 3 270M: no gain).

## 💬 Language Models

*Reading, repairing and writing the weights of language models.*

### Repairing behavior

- **[weights_editing: replicating Sparks of Weight-Space Programming across LLMs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/weights_editing)**  
  The Alan Turing Institute · *GitHub* · 2026-11-03 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Code](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/weights_editing)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/alan-turing-institute/weights_editing?style=social)  
  Replicates the weight-editing experiments with several LLMs as the editor.

- **[OpenWSP](https://github.com/openwsp/openwsp)**  
  OpenWSP · *GitHub* · 2026-11-03 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Code](https://github.com/openwsp/openwsp)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/openwsp/openwsp?style=social)  
  An open replication with a Python kernel over weights, a forward-pass service and a versioned edit format (CLI, SDK and MCP server). The math replication was in progress when checked, and its one-shot car repair with an open model failed.

### Reading and predicting from weights

- **[Weight-space programming autoresearch](https://github.com/csinva/weight-space-programming-autoresearch)**  
  csinva · *GitHub* · 2026-11 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Code](https://github.com/csinva/weight-space-programming-autoresearch)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/csinva/weight-space-programming-autoresearch?style=social)  
  Claude, running as a coding agent, hand-writes transformer weights: 959 programs, and all 10 algorithmic tasks reach 100% within three attempts. A second test is mostly negative: Claude Opus 5.5 reading Qwen3.5-0.8B weights predicts the effects of 420 edits only slightly better than without the numbers (+0.06 correlation).

## 🦾 Robotics and Control

*Weight edits on robot policies, VLAs, world action models and controllers.*

### Vision-language-action models

- **[Astra weight edits on a VLA, a world action model and humanoid control](https://x.com/Lingxiao234/status/2118048171649806424)**  
  Lingxiao Guo, Angchen Xie · *X thread* · 2026-11-04 · `💬 post only`  
  [[Thread](https://x.com/Lingxiao234/status/2118048171649806424)]  
  π0.5 on 5 RoboTwin 2.0 tasks: 27% to 65% with about 4 edits on held-out episodes; on one task 4 of 3.6B parameters took success from 28/92 to 82/92. FastWAM gains 8.7 points. Unitree G1 policies adapt to a hidden payload by rewiring waist and knee gains. Candidates are found by probing saved inputs offline, then checked with rollouts.

- **[Weight-Space Programming for VLAs](https://github.com/Geeksongs/Weight-Space-Programming-VLA)**  
  Geeksongs · *GitHub* · 2026-11-04 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Code](https://github.com/Geeksongs/Weight-Space-Programming-VLA)] [[Model](https://huggingface.co/pythonsong/smolvla-libero-wsp-B35)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Geeksongs/Weight-Space-Programming-VLA?style=social)  
  Changing one number in SmolVLA (the x-action output bias) lifts a LIBERO-Spatial task from 42/100 to 64/100 on unseen initial states (Fisher p = 0.003). The fault was read off rollouts: the gripper closed too far along x and regrasped.

### RL control policies

- **[Policy Surgery](https://github.com/latentpaths/policy-surgery)**  
  latentpaths · *GitHub* · 2026-11-02 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Code](https://github.com/latentpaths/policy-surgery)] [[Project](https://www.latentpaths.com/projects/policy-surgery)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/latentpaths/policy-surgery?style=social)  
  GPT-OSS-120B edits a 4,996-parameter LunarLander PPO actor after its dynamics change. Reversed thrusters: 0 to 226 of 256 held-out episodes. Crosswind and reduced thrust gain 3 to 6 points, and only one of those intervals excludes zero. Separate selection, approval and test seeds, with every failure kept.

## 🧩 Other Domains

*Classifiers, small decision networks and anything else.*

- **[Weight-space programming for auditing clinical decision networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.05341)**  
  Henry Ford Health · *Preprint* · 2026-11-03 · `📝 preprint`  
  [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.05341)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/hnusrat1/weightspace-rt?style=social)  
  Claude Opus 5.5 audited small head-and-neck planning-request screening networks (433 to 4,801 parameters) blind, without tools, data or code execution. It named the broken rule in 16 of 18 flawed networks and repaired each of the 16 by changing a median of 3 parameters. Checks used about 420,000 requests.

## 📊 Benchmarks and Evaluations

*Controlled tests of whether weight access helps.*

- **[WSPBench](https://github.com/alexcarterhq/wspbench)**  
  alexcarterhq · *GitHub* · 2026-11-03 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Code](https://github.com/alexcarterhq/wspbench)] [[Project](https://wspbench.com)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/alexcarterhq/wspbench?style=social)  
  Does weight access help an agent diagnose and repair a model? GPT-6.1 Sol repaired 30/32 faults with behavior probes plus weights, against 14/32 with probes alone and 5/32 for a scripted solver at the same probe budget. All three kept 8 clean controls intact.

## 🛠️ Tools, Harnesses and Agent Skills

*Libraries and agent skills for reading and editing weights.*

## 🔍 Analyses and Critiques

*Audits, replications of claims and critical takes.*

- **[The 'Astra can read and write weights to improve Qwen' post is misleading](https://honnibal.dev/blog/astra-read-write-misleading)**  
  Matthew Honnibal · *Blog* · 2026-11-03 · `💬 post only`  
  [[Post](https://honnibal.dev/blog/astra-read-write-misleading)]  
  Separates reading weights directly from repairing a model with code and practice feedback: raw-weight reading without tools appears only on the smallest networks, and the language-model results used Python and forward passes.

Critics say its biggest result relied on standard ML engineering.](https://www.rdworldonline.com/mit-team-says-gpt-6-astra-can-fix-an-ai-model-by-editing-its-weights-critics-say-the-method-was-standard-ml-engineering/)**

## Legend

`📄 peer-reviewed` · `📝 preprint` · `💻 code / results` · `💬 post only`

Entries are newest first within each section. Summaries report the source's own numbers and settings. Evidence labels say what kind of source backs an entry, not whether its claims hold.

## How This List Is Maintained

A daily automated sweep checks arXiv, GitHub and the Hugging Face Hub for new work on weight-space programming. Entries need to do weight-space programming or be direct groundwork for it. Papers should come from an identifiable research group or release code; repositories should show traction or report a held-out result. Categories grow as the field does: a new section opens when work no longer fits the existing ones. Corrections are welcome as issues or pull requests.
