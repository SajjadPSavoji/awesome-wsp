*Weight-space programming* was named in the MIT CSAIL report [Sparks of Weight-Space Programming](https://rikiyat.github.io/blog/weight-space-programming/) (2026-11-02). A general LLM is given another network's weights, sometimes with code and a budget of forward passes, and changes the numbers to explain, repair or build behavior. This list tracks the papers, code, benchmarks and critiques that follow, grouped by the kind of network being programmed. It is rebuilt from [`data/entries.json`](https://github.com/SajjadPSavoji/awesome-weight-space-programming/blob/main/data/entries.json).

## 🌟 The Original Report

*Where the term comes from.*

- **[Sparks of Weight-Space Programming: LLMs can natively read & write neural network weights](https://rikiyat.github.io/blog/weight-space-programming/)**  
  MIT CSAIL · *Blog report* · 2026-11-02 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Post](https://rikiyat.github.io/blog/weight-space-programming/)] [[Thread](https://x.com/rikiyatakehi/status/2117313742891327994)] [[Code](https://github.com/RikiyaT/lm_understand-logs)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RikiyaT/lm_understand-logs?style=social)  
  GPT-6 Astra names what networks were trained on from their weights alone, repairs a stuck Kinetix car policy (0% to 100%, 3.5% of weights, one reply, no tools), writes MinAtar and 9x9 Go networks from zero, and lifts Qwen3.5-0.8B on MATH-500 from 7.9% to 48.1% by removing a loop direction (0.016% of weights). Edits removed a blocker; they did not add a missing ability (Gemma 3 270M: no gain).

## 💬 Language Models

*Reading, repairing and writing the weights of language models.*

### Repairing behavior

- **[fderrigo/weight-space-programming-experiments](https://github.com/fderrigo/weight-space-programming-experiments)**

  Code, patches and results for two no-training edits chosen by Codex. Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct Pinocchio fix changed 8.868% of values: target answers 0/24 to 11/24, with 7/8 original controls preserved. Qwen3-0.6B patch raised unauthorized tool calls on target requests from 1/40 to 13/40; selectivity incomplete.

  An open replication with a Python kernel over weights, a forward-pass service and a versioned edit format (CLI, SDK and MCP server). Its own one-shot GPT-6 Astra rerun of the car repair failed (0/1,024, 2,918 weights changed).

### Reading and predicting from weights

- **[Can GPT-6 Astra read and write GPT-2's weights?](https://github.com/AlexBodner/wsp-scaling)**  
  Alex Bodner · *GitHub* · 2026-11-05 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Code](https://github.com/AlexBodner/wsp-scaling)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/AlexBodner/wsp-scaling?style=social)  
  Asks GPT-6 Astra to find induction heads in scrambled GPT-2 small (124M) weights. With Python and no hint it picked all five induction heads in both runs (10 of 10 picks); with no tools, 0 of 10. Silencing the five heads cuts repeat accuracy from 98.6% to 28.9%. One model, few runs, no size sweep.

- **[Weight-space programming autoresearch](https://github.com/csinva/weight-space-programming-autoresearch)**  
  csinva · *GitHub* · 2026-11 · `💻 code / results`

  Claude, running as a coding agent, hand-writes transformer weights: 959 programs, and all 10 algorithmic tasks reach 100% within three attempts. A second test is mostly negative: Claude Opus 5.5 reading Qwen3.5-0.8B weights predicts the effects of 420 edits only slightly better than without the numbers (+0.06 correlation).

### Writing networks from scratch

  Writes parameters of a randomly initialized model with the Qwen3.5-0.8B architecture directly, without gradient descent, to answer ABAP questions. Reports 18/25 correct in a small, unblinded static review, with random controls at 0/25. Includes 7 supplied-answer recall cases; not an expert ABAP model.

## 🦾 Robotics and Control

*Weight edits on robot policies, VLAs, world action models and controllers.*

### Vision-language-action models

- **[Opus 5.5 makes π0.5 move faster and smoother by editing its weights](https://cuzyoung.github.io/robotics-weight-editing/en/)**  
  Shanghai Innovation Institute, SJTU, HKU · *Project page* · 2026-11-05 · `💬 post only`  
  [[Post](https://cuzyoung.github.io/robotics-weight-editing/en/)] [[Code](https://github.com/Cuzyoung/robotics-weight-editing)]  
  Claude Opus 5.5, working in Claude Code from recorded rollouts, changed 1.16% of a Training-Time-RTC π0.5 for a real YAM bimanual robot. Bottle placement got 12.0% faster at 40 Hz and jumps between action chunks fell 89.8%; both policies kept 100% success (3 runs per condition). The edits were a RoPE intervention fitted into Q/K weights by least squares and a repair of a prefix-handling bug in official RTC. Project page only, no code or weights.

- **[Astra weight edits on a VLA, a world action model and humanoid control](https://x.com/Lingxiao234/status/2118048171649806424)**  
  Lingxiao Guo, Angchen Xie · *X thread* · 2026-11-04 · `💬 post only`  
  [[Thread](https://x.com/Lingxiao234/status/2118048171649806424)]  
  π0.5 on 5 RoboTwin 2.0 tasks: 27% to 65% with about 4 edits on held-out episodes; on one task 4 of 3.6B parameters took success from 28/92 to 82/92. FastWAM gains 8.7 points. Unitree G1 policies adapt to a hidden payload by rewiring waist and knee gains. Candidates are found by probing saved inputs offline, then checked with rollouts. Each edited π0.5 was fine-tuned on one task, so gains hold for that task only; no code or paper as of 2026-11-05.

- **[Weight-Space Programming for VLAs](https://github.com/Geeksongs/Weight-Space-Programming-VLA)**  
  Geeksongs · *GitHub* · 2026-11-04 · `💻 code / results`

  Changing one number in SmolVLA (the x-action output bias) lifts a LIBERO-Spatial task from 42/100 to 64/100 on unseen initial states (Fisher p = 0.003). The fault was read off rollouts: the gripper closed too far along x and regrasped.

### RL control policies

- **[wsp-lab: cross-editor stress test of weight-space programming](https://github.com/WKJBryan/wsp-lab)**  
  WKJBryan · *GitHub* · 2026-11-05 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Code](https://github.com/WKJBryan/wsp-lab)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WKJBryan/wsp-lab?style=social)  
  An agentic GLM-5.3 editor repaired a CartPole MLP from 9.4 to 371.6 return, while a matched-norm random edit scored 9.5. Pre-registered, with an untouched baseline and a retraining upper bound; a blind Qwen3.5-0.8B repair gave no gain.

- **[Admiral: Muse Spark repairs a multi-agent RL policy by editing its weights](https://github.com/faresboudelaa/admiral)**  
  Fares Boudelaa · *GitHub* · 2026-11-04 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Code](https://github.com/faresboudelaa/admiral)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/faresboudelaa/admiral?style=social)  
  Meta Muse Spark built a gated "steer home" circuit in a 163,874-parameter MAPPO capture-the-flag boat policy (PyQuaticus), changing 2.9% of weights. Against the hard heuristic opponent, paired score rose +0.36 over 200 held-out matches; against medium, +0.01 (not significant). Ships a reusable sandboxed numpy kernel with a match budget and a no-training audit.

- **[Quadrotor PPO under actuation delay: LLM weight edits vs a gain sweep](https://github.com/filippos-p/drone-ppo-delay-robustness)**  
  filippos-p · *GitHub* · 2026-11-04 · `💻 code / results`  
  [[Code](https://github.com/filippos-p/drone-ppo-delay-robustness)] ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/filippos-p/drone-ppo-delay-robustness?style=social)  
  Two LLMs each made one blind edit to a PyBullet quadrotor policy. At 4 ms delay the original succeeds 5%, the LLM edits 16% and 12%, a 28-variant output-gain sweep 67% and retraining for 7M steps 61%; at 8 ms or more the LLM edits score 0–1%. A clear case of a scripted baseline beating the LLM edit.

- **[Weight-space programming for F1TENTH autonomous racing](https://github.com/Ro0t-set/f1tenth-weight-space-racing)**

  A hosted Qwen editor repairs injected faults in a 17,253-parameter Breakout policy behind a verifier gate, publishing accepted weights to Hugging Face. A useful negative result: the one accepted repair just restored the known reference policy, one run made 123 turns without submitting an edit, and a later qualified repair improved sampled play while greedy return fell from 10.25 to 1.57. Follow-up repo: FailureIsAllYouNeed.

  Experiments editing and writing models without gradient descent, plus a wsl CLI that applies reversible weight patches with per-slice regression checks. A hand-written XGBoost model reached AUC 0.809 on rain forecasting with zero labels (0.839 when trained on 2.5 years). On a 0.8B LLM, the author's edit did not reproduce the published effect.

Reports its own CPU runs on Qwen3-0.6B and GPT2-124M: in 60-item list-looping tests no edit passed the gate, so 0 weights shipped. Only the smoke-test pipeline passed (failing score 64.14 → 75.43).

Entries are newest first within each section. Summaries report the source's own numbers and settings. Evidence labels say what kind of source backs an entry, not whether its claims hold.

## How This List Is Maintained

An automated sweep (daily) checks arXiv, GitHub and the Hugging Face Hub for new work. Entries need to do weight-space programming or be direct groundwork for it. On-topic papers are listed whatever their traction; repositories are listed once they show traction or come from an organization, and young ones are kept on a watch list and re-checked. Categories grow as the field does: a new section opens when work no longer fits the existing ones. Corrections are welcome as issues or pull requests.
